# Maze_Game
GUI proyect in Python where I developed a simple video game that responds to clicks and keyboard entries.

Uses graphics module only.

There is a small bug in the program purposely implemented. Those who can find it can earn the highest score.

A nice little Easter Egg ;)

game.py contains the Python script for the GUI.

scores.txt containes the leaderboard that will be modified once the game is completed.
